# Files Templates Manager

This extension allows you to create templates of files to add to the root of your project.
You could use this to store your styles guidelines and easy add them to your new projects

## Commands

`FTM: Generate files from template`: Allows you to create the files of the configuration on the root of your project

`FTM: Import Config Zip`: Allows you to import the content of a `.zip` file to make a configuration. The imported configurations will have the prefix `IMPORTED - ` before the file name.

This is my first try at a vscode extension please be gentle with it.

**Enjoy!**
